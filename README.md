<h3> Specific Problem Identified:</h3>

<p>The primary issue hindering Anderson Dawes from connecting to the network printer is an incorrect printer IP address configuration on his laptop. After the recent network upgrade, the IP addresses of several devices, including printers, were changed to accommodate the new networking schema. However, Anderson's laptop retained the old IP address for the printer, leading to failed connection attempts. This misconfiguration is a common oversight following network modifications, especially if devices are manually configured or if the update communication does not reach all users effectively.


</p>


<h3> Resolution Steps:</h3>

- Update Printer IP Address on Anderson's Laptop
- This can be done by accessing the printer properties via the Control Panel (or Settings app in Windows 11) and updating the port configuration under the 'Ports' tab to the new IP address. This can be done by accessing the printer properties via the Control Panel (or Settings app in Windows 11) and updating the port configuration under the 'Ports' tab to the new IP address.
